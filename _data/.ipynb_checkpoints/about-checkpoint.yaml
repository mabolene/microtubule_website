  Microtubule Catastrophe Distributions

  Michael Anne Bolene, Malaika Cordeiro
Abstract: >
  We did lots of analysis on microtubule catastrophe data, including modeling with gamma distribution and 2-beta distibution
Summary:  >
  By using graphical model assessment and AIC weights, we found that the Gamma distribution is a  better fit. This is evident in Interactive Figure 2. As you can see in that figure, for almost all concentrations involved, the predictive data matches the observed data better in the Gamma distribution than the mixture "2-beta" model.
